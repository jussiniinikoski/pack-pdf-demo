## WASM-PDF Demo

Example that generates a sample PDF document from JSON file. Title in PDF is changed dynamically (in JavaScript) to show current date. **Note:** this example routes directly to the PDF data blob, so 2 backsteps are needed to return to this page.

Another example that generates 400 paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum and shows a download link when document has been generated (which is instantly 🙂). Also shows page numbers.
